# jQuery postMessage: Cross-domain scripting goodness #
[http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/)

Version: 0.5, Last updated: 9/11/2009

jQuery postMessage enables simple and easy window.postMessage communication in browsers that support it (FF3, Safari 4, IE8), while falling back to a document.location.hash communication method for all other browsers (IE6, IE7, Opera).

With the addition of the window.postMessage method, JavaScript finally has a fantastic means for cross-domain frame communication. Unfortunately, this method isn't supported in all browsers. One example where this plugin is useful is when a child Iframe needs to tell its parent that its contents have resized.
